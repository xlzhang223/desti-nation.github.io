1. `resurgence`复活，再现

> Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning (ML), has seen a dramatic  **resurgence** in the past 6 years, largely driven by increases in computational power and the availability of massive new datasets.

2. `physician`医师  `demonstration`示范 `wounds`伤口

> RL can be useful in healthcare whenever(每当) learning requires physician demonstration, for instance in learning to suture wounds for robotic-assisted surgery.
